## by Karine Legrand

## from the "Data Analyst Nanodegree Program" - Udacity Certificate

### This project consisted in conducting a data analysis on medical patients records in Brazil, to try and answer the question, why about 30% of the patients, would not show up to their appointments.

#### Learning goals: Go through the whole data analysis process and aquiring skills like:
 - Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
 - Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
 - Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
 - Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
 - Programming in python and using data analysis libraries standards such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib and more precisely:
   - Be able to use vectorized operations in numpy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
   - Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
   - Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings


#### The Steps taken to achieve this Analysis are described in the Project File _"noshow\_appointment.html"_ and the corresponding jupyter notebook _"noshow\_appointment.ipynb"_

#### The dataset was imported as "appointments.csv" file, from the site Kaggle.com and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

#### _The review from a Udacity mentor, is also included, validating that the project passed successfully for certification_
